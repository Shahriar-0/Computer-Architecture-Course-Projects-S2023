## Intro

Projects for the computer architecture course at Tehran university. Some parts were inspired by last semester projects that you can find [here](https://github.com/MisaghM/Computer-Architecture-Course-Projects), the archive folder is linked to that repository.

## CA 1: Maze

### Maze-Intro

In this project we were supposed to 

```text
Group 1:
- Saman Eslami Nazari : 810199375
- Pasha Barahimi      : 810199385
- Misagh Mohaghegh    : 810199484
```

### Maze-Asset

The following keyboard shortcuts are added to the console:

- `Ctrl+N` : Removes all the digits from the console
- `Ctrl+R` : Reverses the current line
- `Tab`    : Substitutes the current line with a command from the history (if exists)

Also, the following features are added to the console though they were not required in the task:

- `Arrow Up`   : Shows the previous command in the history
- `Arrow Down` : Shows the next command in the history

### Maze-code

A `prime_numbers` program is added to the system.  
This program finds the prime numbers in the range $[a, b]$.  
The program is called as follows:

```text
prime_numbers a b
```

The result is then printed in the `prime_numbers.txt` file.
